# GNES-Grecko-Numeric-Encoding-System
GNES is an ongoing encoding system based on hexadecimals and polynominals. At this current stage {April 23 2016} A public release is in progress. Any hexidecimal libraries can be added for the time being but expect them to be removed later if unneccesary. 
Thank you, Kieran K- Creator of GNES
